     <strong> Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a retired 
long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft 
     </strong>
developed and manufactured by the 
<strong> 
  American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. 
</strong>
Its nicknames include <strong> "Blackbird"</strong> and
<strong> "Habu"</strong>.
The SR-71 was developed in the 1960s as a black project by Lockheed's 
Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" 
Johnson was responsible for many of the SR-71's innovative concepts. 
Its shape was based on the Lockheed A-12, a pioneer in stealth 
technology with its reduced radar cross section, but the SR-71 was 
longer and heavier to carry more fuel and a crew of two in tandem 
cockpits. The SR-71 was revealed to the public in July 1964 and entered 
service in the United States Air Force (USAF) in January 1966.
During missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes 
(Mach 3.2 at 85,000 ft or 26,000 m), allowing it to evade or outrace 
threats. If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard 
evasive action was to accelerate and outpace the missile. Equipment 
for the plane's aerial reconnaissance missions included 
signals-intelligence sensors, side-looking airborne radar, and a camera.
 On average, an SR-71 could fly just once per week because of the 
 lengthy preparations needed. A total of 32 aircraft were built;
12 were lost in accidents, none to enemy action.
In 1974, the SR-71 set the record for the quickest flight between 
London and New York. In 1976, it became the fastest airbreathing 
manned aircraft, previously held by its predecessor, the closely related
 Lockheed YF-12. As of 2025, the Blackbird still holds all three world 
 records. In 1989, the USAF retired the SR-71, largely for political 
 reasons, although several were briefly reactivated before their second
retirement in 1998. NASA was the final operator of the Blackbird, 
using it as a research platform, until it was retired again in 1999.
Since its retirement, the SR-71's role has been taken up by a 
combination of reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles 
(UAVs). As of 2018, Lockheed Martin was developing a proposed UAV 
successor, the SR-72, with plans to fly it in 2025.

<h2> Background </h2> <br>
<h3> Main article: Lockheed A-12 </h3> <br>
Lockheed's previous reconnaissance aircraft was the relatively slow 
U-2, designed for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In late 1957, 
the CIA approached the defense contractor Lockheed to build an 
undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by 
Kelly Johnson, head of Lockheed's Skunk Works unit in Burbank, 
California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter 
of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 
11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, "A-10" was the 
front-runner, although its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection.
 After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified 
 to reduce its radar cross-section by 90%. On 11 February 1960, 
 the CIA approved a US$96 million (~$758 million in 2023) contract for 
 Skunk Works to build a dozen A-12 spy planes. Three months later, 
 the May 1960 downing of Francis Gary Powers's U-2 underscored the 
 need for less vulnerable reconnaissance aircraft.

The A-12 first flew at Groom Lake (Area 51), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. 
Thirteen were built, plus five more of two variants: three of the YF-12
 interceptor prototype and two of the M-21 drone carrier. The aircraft 
 was to be powered by the Pratt & Whitney J58 engine, but J58 
 development was taking longer than scheduled, so it was initially 
 equipped with the lower-thrust Pratt & Whitney J75 to enable flight 
 testing to begin. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, 
 and became the standard engine for all subsequent aircraft in the 
 series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71. The A-12 flew 
 missions over Vietnam and North Korea before its retirement in 1968. 
 The program's cancellation was announced on 28 December 1966, 
 due both to budget concerns and because of the forthcoming SR-71, 
 a derivative of the A-12.

<br>
The SR-71 designation is a continuation of the pre-1962 bomber series; 
the last aircraft built using the series was the XB-70 Valkyrie. 
However, a bomber variant of the Blackbird was briefly given the B-71 
designator, which was retained when the type was changed to SR-71.
During the later stages of its testing, the B-70 was proposed for a 
reconnaissance/strike role, with an "RS-70" designation. When the 
A-12's performance potential was clearly found to be much greater, 
the USAF ordered a variant of the A-12 in December 1962, which was 
originally named R-12 by Lockheed. This USAF version was longer and 
heavier than the original A-12 because it had a longer fuselage to hold 
more fuel. The R-12 also had a crew of two in tandem cockpits, and 
reshaped fuselage chines. Reconnaissance equipment included signals 
intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo camera. 
The CIA's A-12 was a better photo-reconnaissance platform than the 
USAF's R-12: since the A-12 flew higher and faster, and with only a 
pilot, it had room to carry a better camera and more instruments. 
The A-12 flew covert missions while the SR-71 flew overt missions; 
the latter had USAF markings and pilots carried Geneva Conventions 
Identification Cards.During the 1964 campaign, Republican presidential 
nominee Barry Goldwater repeatedly criticized President 
Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration for falling behind the 
Soviet Union in developing new weapons. Johnson decided to counter this
 criticism by revealing the existence of the YF-12A USAF interceptor, 
 which also served as cover for the still-secret A-12 and the USAF 
 reconnaissance model since July 1964. USAF Chief of Staff General 
 Curtis LeMay preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation 
 and wanted the RS-71 to be named SR-71. Before the July speech, 
 LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson's speech to read "SR-71" instead of 
 "RS-71". The media transcript given to the press at the time still had
  the earlier RS-71 designation in places, creating the story that the 
  president had misread the aircraft's designation. 
  To conceal the A-12's existence, Johnson referred only to the A-11, 
  while revealing the existence of a high-speed, high-altitude 
  reconnaissance aircraft.
In 1968, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara canceled the F-12 
interceptor program. The specialized tooling used to manufacture both 
the YF-12 and the SR-71 was also ordered destroyed. 
Production of the SR-71 totaled 32 aircraft: 
29 SR-71As, two SR-71Bs, and one SR-71C.

     <h1> Design </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>

<h3>Tandem cockpits</h3>
<img src = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Evergreen_Aviation_%26_Space_Museum_Oregon12.jpg/250px-Evergreen_Aviation_%26_Space_Museum_Oregon12.jpg>
<br>The SR-71 was designed for flight at over Mach 3 with tandem cockpits 
for a crew of two: a pilot; and a reconnaissance systems officer who 
navigated and operated the surveillance systems. It was extremely 
important for the pilot and RSO to work well together as a crew. 
The SR-71 was designed with the smallest radar cross-section that 
Lockheed could achieve, an early attempt at stealth design. 
Aircraft were painted black. This color radiated heat from the surface 
more effectively than the bare metal, reducing the temperature of the 
skin and thermal stresses on the airframe. 
The appearance of the painted aircraft gave it the nickname "Blackbird".

<h2> Airframe, canopy, and landing gear </h2>
Titanium was used for 85% of the structure, with much of the rest being 
polymer composite materials. To control costs, Lockheed used a more 
easily worked titanium alloy, which softened at a lower temperature. 
The challenges posed led Lockheed to develop new fabrication methods, 
which have since been used in the manufacture of other aircraft. 
Lockheed found that washing welded titanium requires distilled water, 
as the chlorine present in tap water is corrosive; cadmium-plated 
tools could not be used, as they also caused corrosion. Metallurgical 
contamination was another problem; at one point, 80% of the delivered 
titanium for manufacture was rejected on these grounds.
The high temperatures generated in flight required special design and 
operating techniques. Major sections of the skin of the inboard wings 
were corrugated, not smooth. Aerodynamicists initially opposed the 
concept, disparagingly referring to the aircraft as a Mach 3 variant of 
the 1920s-era Ford Trimotor, which was known for its corrugated aluminum
 skin. But high heat would have caused a smooth skin to split or curl, 
 whereas the corrugated skin could expand vertically and horizontally 
 and had increased longitudinal strength.
Fuselage panels were manufactured to fit only loosely with the aircraft 
on the ground. Proper alignment was achieved as the airframe heated up, 
with thermal expansion of several inches. Because of this, and the lack 
of a fuel-sealing system that could remain leak-free with the extreme 
temperature cycles during flight, the aircraft leaked JP-7 fuel on the 
ground prior to takeoff, annoying ground crews.
The outer windscreen of the cockpit was made of three layers of glass 
with cooling sections between them. The ANS navigation window was made 
of solid quartz and was fused ultrasonically to the titanium frame. 
The temperature of the exterior of the windscreen could reach 600 °F 
(320 °C) during a mission.<br>

The Blackbird's tires, manufactured by B.F. Goodrich, contained 
aluminum and were inflated with nitrogen. They cost $2,300 each and 
generally required replacing within 20 missions. The Blackbird landed at
 more than 170 knots (200 mph; 310 km/h) and deployed a drag parachute 
 to reduce landing roll and brake and tire wear.

<h2> Shape and threat avoidance </h2>

Water vapor is condensed by the low-pressure vortices generated by the 
chines outboard of each engine inlet.
The SR-71 was the second operational aircraft, after the Lockheed 
A-12, designed to be hard to spot on radar. Early studies in stealth 
technology indicated that a shape with flattened, tapering sides would 
reflect most radar energy away from a beam's place of origin, so Lockheed's
 engineers added chines and canted the vertical control surfaces inward.
  Special radar-absorbing materials were incorporated into 
  sawtooth-shaped sections of the aircraft's skin. Cesium-based fuel 
  additives were used to somewhat reduce the visibility of exhaust 
  plumes to radar, although exhaust streams remained quite apparent. 
  Ultimately, engineers produced an aircraft with a wing area of about 
  1,800 sq ft (170 m2) but a radar cross-section (RCS) of around 
  110 sq ft (10 m2). Johnson later conceded that Soviet radar technology
   advanced faster than the stealth technology employed against it.
While the SR-71 carried radar countermeasures to evade interception 
efforts, its greatest protection was its combination of high altitude 
and very high speed, which made it invulnerable at the time. 
Along with its low radar cross-section, these qualities gave a very 
short time for an enemy surface-to-air missile (SAM) site to acquire 
and track the aircraft on radar. By the time the SAM site could track 
the SR-71, it was often too late to launch a SAM, and the SR-71 would 
be out of range before the SAM could catch up to it. If the SAM site 
could track the SR-71 and fire a SAM in time, the SAM would expend 
nearly all of the delta-v of its boost and sustainer phases just 
reaching the SR-71's altitude; at this point, out of thrust, it could do
 little more than follow its ballistic arc. Merely accelerating would 
 typically be enough for an SR-71 to evade a SAM; changes by the pilots 
 in the SR-71's speed, altitude, and heading were also often enough to 
 spoil any radar lock on the plane by SAM sites or enemy fighters. 
 At sustained speeds of more than Mach 3.2, the plane was faster than 
 the Soviet Union's fastest interceptor, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25,
 which also could not reach the SR-71's altitude. No SR-71 was ever shot
 down.

The SR-71 featured chines, a pair of sharp edges leading aft from either
 side of the nose along the fuselage. These were not a feature on the 
 early A-3 design; Frank Rodgers, a doctor at the Scientific 
 Engineering Institute, a CIA front organization, discovered that a 
 cross-section of a sphere had a greatly reduced radar reflection, and 
 adapted a cylindrical-shaped fuselage by stretching out the sides of 
 the fuselage. After the advisory panel provisionally selected Convair's
  FISH design over the A-3 on the basis of RCS, Lockheed adopted chines
   for its A-4 through A-6 designs.

Aerodynamicists discovered that the chines generated powerful vortices 
and created additional lift, leading to unexpected aerodynamic performance 
improvements. For example, they allowed a reduction in the wings' angle 
of incidence, which added stability and reduced drag at high speeds, 
allowing more weight to be carried, such as fuel. Landing speeds were 
also reduced, as the chines' vortices created turbulent flow over the 
wings at high angles of attack, making it harder to stall. The chines 
also acted like leading-edge extensions, which increase the agility of 
fighters such as the F-5, F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29, and Su-27. The addition 
of chines also allowed the removal of the planned canard foreplanes.

    <h2> Propulsion system or powerplant </h2>
<h3> Complete powerplant </h3>
The SR-71 used the same powerplant as the A-12 and YF-12. It consists 
of three main parts: inlet, J58 engine and its nacelle, and ejector 
nozzle. "Typical for any supersonic powerplant the engine cannot be 
considered separately from the rest of the powerplant. Rather, it may 
be regarded as the heat pump in the over-all system of inlet, engine, 
and nozzle. The net thrust available to propel the aircraft may be to 
a large extent controlled by the performance of the inlet and nozzle 
rather than by the physical potentialities of the engine alone." 
This is illustrated for the Blackbird by the thrust contributions from 
each component at Mach 3+ with maximum afterburner: inlet 54%, engine 
17.6%, ejector nozzle 28.4%.
When stationary and at low speeds the inlet caused a loss in engine 
thrust. This was due to the flow restriction through the inlet when 
stationary. Thrust was recovered with ram pressure as flight speed 
increased (uninstalled thrust 34,000 lb (150 kN), installed at zero 
airspeed 25,500 lb (113 kN) rising through 30,000 lb (130 kN) at 210 
knots, unstick speed).
At supersonic speeds not all the airflow approaching the inlet capture 
area entered the inlet. At supersonic speeds an intake always adapts to 
the engine requirements, rather than forcing air into the engine, and 
the unwanted air flows around the outside of the cowl, causing spillage 
drag. More than half the air approaching the capture area had to be 
spilled at low supersonic speeds and the amount reduced as the design 
speed was approached because the inlet airflow had been designed to match 
the engine demand at that speed and the chosen design point ambient 
temperature. At this speed the spike shock touched the cowl lip and 
there was minimal spillage (with its attendant drag) as shown by 
Campbell. The inlet and engine matching was also shown by Brown, 
who emphasized the benefit of increased engine airflow at higher Mach 
numbers that came with the introduction of the bleed bypass cycle. These 
two authors show the disparity between inlet and engine for the Blackbird 
in terms of airflow and it is further explained in more general terms by 
Oates.
Engine operation was adversely affected when operating behind an 
unstarted inlet. In this condition the inlet behaved like a subsonic 
inlet design (known as a pitot type) at high supersonic speeds, with 
very low airflow to the engine. Fuel was automatically diverted, by 
the fuel derich system, from the combustor to prevent turbine 
over-temperature.
All three parts were linked by the secondary airflow. The inlet needed 
the boundary layers removed from its spike and cowl surfaces. The one 
with the higher pressure recovery, the cowl shock-trap bleed, was 
chosen as secondary air to ventilate and cool the outside of the engine. 
It was assisted from the inlet by the pumping action of the engine 
exhaust in the ejector nozzle, cushioning the engine exhaust as it 
expanded over a wide range of pressure ratios which increased with 
flight speed.
Mach 3.2 in a standard day atmosphere was the design point for the 
aircraft. However, in practice the SR-71 was more efficient at even 
faster speeds and colder temperatures. The specific range charts showed 
for a standard day temperature, and a particular weight, that Mach 3.0 
cruise used 38,000 lb/h (17,000 kg/h) of fuel. At Mach 3.15 the fuel 
flow was 36,000 lb/h (16,000 kg/h). Flying in colder temperatures (known
 as temperature deviations from the standard day) would also reduce the 
 fuel used, e.g. with a 14 °F (−10 °C) temperature the fuel flow was 
 35,000 lb/h (16,000 kg/h). During one mission, SR-71 pilot Brian 
 Shul flew faster than usual to avoid multiple interception attempts. 
 It was discovered after the flight that this had reduced the fuel 
 consumption. It is possible to match the powerplant for optimum 
 performance at only one ambient temperature because the airflows for 
 a supersonic inlet and engine vary differently with ambient temperature. 
 For an inlet, the airflow varies inversely with the square root of the 
 temperature, and for the engine, it varies with the direct inverse.
